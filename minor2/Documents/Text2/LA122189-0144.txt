british research found first unambigu evid small chang graviti preced volcan erupt 
articl publish today journal natur research report graviti increas poa volcano costa rica two year period volcano erupt april may 1989 increas graviti thought result intrus dens molten rock volcan cone 
geophysicist helen rymer geoff brown open univers milton keyn england believ measur small chang graviti call micrograv use predict erupt certain type volcano like poa 
rymer specul poa may erupt next april may 
rymer brown also begin monitor micrograv mt 
etna sicili popul area threaten period erupt 
micrograv would seem promis techniqu use predict volcan erupt said geophysicist dan dzurisin u geolog survey cascad volcano observatori washington 
techniqu yet test part monitor chang micrograv extrem labor intens process cannot readili autom 
result studi measur micrograv chang long interv often simpli volcan erupt result open various interpret 
rymer brown studi micrograv measur regular interv 10 year period repres first time see progress micrograv long period time result much clearer said geologist al egger univers puget sound tacoma wash measur gravit chang extraordinarili exact dzurisin said

poa volcano classic cone shape volcano clear deep 120 150 feet lake center 
lake normal quit warm 104 degre fahrenheit indic least molten rock lie close surfac heat 
volcano last erupt 1953 lake fill normal depth remain stabl three decad 
1983 rymer said telephon interview lake level began drop slowli 
1987 rymer brown began detect increas micrograv lake level drop much rapid 
rymer believ molten rock magma caus graviti increas also heat water make evapor faster 
june 1987 geyser water began erupt water level went even faster 
april year water gone volcano erupt mile high cloud ash 
ash erupt subsid spring rain establish lake rymer said believ volcano may erupt lake deplet come dri season 
research know happen graviti level erupt fund expir time volcano erupt 
go back costa rica march take new measur 
lesson learn poa may applic everywher 
although japanes research preliminari evid increas micrograv volcan erupt egger found micrograv actual decreas pacayo volcano guatemala erupt 10 year ago 
egger specul decreas caus format gaseous pocket magma 
still volcano monitor dzurisin other shown appar chang 
like dzurisin said volcano characterist pattern graviti chang chang known pattern use futur predict 
furthermor rymer note poa mt 
etna fill light materi intrus magma readili detect 
case said graviti chang particular use predict tool
